		The underlying theory upon which a great number of statistical procedures are based assumes that the variable or variables sampled are normally distributed.
		While there has been a good deal of theoretical research on the robustness of these procedures,
		the results seem not to have been set out in terms which the unsophisticated user of statistical methods can easily assimilate.
		The present paper, based on extensive computer simulation, aims at relating diagrammatically the shape of population to the robustness of the distribution of four simple statistics.
		A set of 29 Johnson SB and SU curves, several Pearson and Weibull curves and some large-sample histograms have been used as populations. The results indicate the extent to which the population moment ratios $\sqrt{\beta 1}$ and $\sqrt{\beta 2}$ determine the degree of robustness; charts are provided which should help the user, if he has some knowledge of these two parameters, to decide whether the lack of robustness matters from the practical aspect with which he is concerned.

		L-shaped distributions are not rare and are probably far more prevalent than is generally realized.
		They are highly conducive to nonrobustness of normality-assuming statistical tests, and they strongly resist transformation to normality.
		The thinner the tail of the distribution, the more unlikely it is that its L-shapedness will be detected by inspecting a sample drawn from it.
		Yet, as the tail of an L-shaped distribution becomes increasingly shallow, its skewness and kurtosis depart increasingly from their ``normal-distribution'' values, and the distribution becomes increasingly conducive to drastic nonrobustness.
		Worse, a fairly common type of experimental situation in psychological research produces shallow-tailed L-shaped distributions.

		The Type I and II error properties of the t test were evaluated by means of a Monte Carlo study that sampled 8 real distribution shapes identified by T. Micceri (1986, 1989) as being representative of types encountered in psychology and education research.
		Results showed the independent-samples t tests to be reasonably robust to Type I error when (1) sample sizes are equal, (2) sample sizes are fairly large, and (3) tests are 2-tailed rather than 1-tailed. 
		Nonrobust results were obtained primarily under distributions with extreme skew.
		The t test was robust to Type II error under these nonnormal distributions,
		but researchers should not overlook robust nonparametric competitors that are often more powerful than the t test when its underlying assumptions are violated.

		Parametric statistics are based on the assumption of normality.
		Recent findings suggest that Type I error and power can be adversely affected when data are non-normal.
		This paper aims to assess the distributional shape of real data by examining the values of the third and fourth central moments as a measurement of skewness and kurtosis in small samples.
		The analysis concerned 693 distributions with a sample size ranging from 10 to 30.
		Measures of cognitive ability and of other psychological variables were included.
		The results showed that skewness ranged between -2.49 and 2.33.
		The values of kurtosis ranged between -1.92 and 7.41.
		Considering skewness and kurtosis together the results indicated that only 5.5\% of distributions were close to expected values under normality.
		Although extreme contamination does not seem to be very frequent,
		the findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that normality is not the rule with real data.

		Statistical analysis is crucial for research and the choice of analytical technique should take into account the specific distribution of data.
		Although the data obtained from health,
		educational,
		and social sciences research are often not normally distributed,
		there are very few studies detailing which distributions are most likely to represent data in these disciplines.
		The aim of this systematic review was to determine the frequency of appearance of the most common non-normal distributions in the health, 
		educational,
		and social sciences.
		The search was carried out in the Web of Science database,
		from which we retrieved the abstracts of papers published between 2010 and 2015.
		The selection was made on the basis of the title and the abstract,
		and was performed independently by two reviewers.
		The inter-rater reliability for article selection was high (Cohenâ€™s kappa = 0.84),
		and agreement regarding the type of distribution reached 96.5\%.
		A total of 262 abstracts were included in the final review.
		The distribution of the response variable was reported in 231 of these abstracts,
		while in the remaining 31 it was merely stated that the distribution was non-normal.
		In terms of their frequency of appearance,
		the most-common non-normal distributions can be ranked in descending order as follows:
		gamma,
		negative binomial,
		multinomial,
		binomial,
		lognormal,
		and exponential.
		In addition to identifying the distributions most commonly used in empirical studies these results will help researchers to decide which distributions should be included in simulation studies examining statistical procedures.

		The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. 
		The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. 
		mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. 
		This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. 
		In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. 
		mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs.
		Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. 
		Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. 
		mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. 
		This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.

This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.}

  abstract     = {The sandwich estimator, also known as robust covariance matrix estimator, heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimate, or empirical covariance matrix estimator, has achieved increasing use in the econometric literature as well as with the growing popularity of generalized estimating equations. Its virtue is that it provides consistent estimates of the covariance matrix for parameter estimates even when the fitted parametric model fails to hold or is not even specified. Surprisingly though, there has been little discussion of properties of the sandwich method other than consistency. We investigate the sandwich estimator in quasi-likelihood models asymptotically, and in the linear case analytically. We show that under certain circumstances when the quasi-likelihood model is correct, the sandwich estimate is often far more variable than the usual parametric variance estimate. The increased variance is a fixed feature of the method and the price that one pays to obtain consistency even when the parametric model fails or when there is heteroscedasticity. We show that the additional variability directly affects the coverage probability of confidence intervals constructed from sandwich variance estimates. In fact, the use of sandwich variance estimates combined with t-distribution quantiles gives confidence intervals with coverage probability falling below the nominal value. We propose an adjustment to compensate for this fact.},

We also consider two other consistent estimators, namely: the HC3 estimator, which is an approximation to the jackknife estimator, and the weighted bootstrap estimator. Additionally, we evaluate the finite-sample behavior of two bootstrap quasi-t tests: the test based on a single bootstrapping scheme and the test based on a double, nested bootstrapping scheme. The latter is very computer-intensive, but proves to work well in small samples. Finally, we propose a new estimator, which we call HC4; it is tailored to take into account the effect of leverage points in the design matrix on associated quasi-t tests.}

The ordinary least squares estimator of the vector of regression parameters remains unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal under unequal error variances. Many practitioners then choose to base their inferences on such an estimator. The usual practice is to couple it with an asymptotically valid estimation of its covariance matrix, and then carry out hypothesis tests that are valid under heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We use numerical integration methods to compute the exact null distributions of some quasi-t test statistics, and propose a new covariance matrix estimator.

		With fixed predictors,

		for computing confidence intervals (CIs)
		for standardized regression coefficients
		fails to account for the sampling variability

		With random predictors,
		this method also fails to account
		for the sampling variability
		of the predictor standard deviations.
		Nevertheless,
		under some conditions the standard method will produce CIs
		with accurate coverage rates.
		To delineate these conditions,
		we used a Monte Carlo simulation
		to compute empirical CI coverage rates
		in samples drawn from 36 populations
		with a wide range of data characteristics.
		We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates
		for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed
		in the literature:
		noncentrality interval estimation,
		the delta method,
		the percentile bootstrap,
		and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap.
		Our results showed that
		for many data-parameter configurations--for example,
		sample size,
		predictor correlations,
		coefficient of determination (
		$
		R^2
		$
		),
		orientation of $\beta$
		with respect to the eigenvectors
		of the predictor correlation matrix,
		$
		R_X
		$--the standard method produced coverage rates
		that were close to their expected values.
		However,
		when population $R^2$ was large
		and when $\beta$ approached the last eigenvector of
		$
		R_X
		$,
		then the standard method coverage rates
		were frequently below the nominal rate
		(sometimes by a considerable amount).
		In these conditions,
		the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures
		were consistently accurate.
		Results using noncentrality interval estimation
		were inconsistent.
		In light of these findings,
		we recommend that researchers use the delta method
		to evaluate the sampling variability
		of standardized regression coefficients.

		Mediation models are often used as a means to explain the psychological mechanisms between an independent and a dependent variable in the behavioral and social sciences. A major limitation of the unstandardized indirect effect calculated from raw scores is that it cannot be interpreted as an effect-size measure. In contrast, the standardized indirect effect calculated from standardized scores can be a good candidate as a measure of effect size because it is scale invariant. In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation. These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI. The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability. Mplus, LISREL, and Mx syntax were included to facilitate the use of these preferred methods in applied settings. Future issues on the use of the standardized indirect effects are discussed.

		We propose a two-stage method for comparing standardized coefficients in structural equation modeling (SEM). At stage 1, we transform the original model of interest into the standardized model by model reparameterization, so that the model parameters appearing in the standardized model are equivalent to the standardized parameters of the original model. At stage 2, we impose appropriate linear equality constraints on the standardized model and use a likelihood ratio test to make statistical inferences about the equality of standardized coefficients. Unlike other existing methods for comparing standardized coefficients, the proposed method does not require specific modeling features (e.g., specification of nonlinear constraints), which are available only in certain SEM software programs. Moreover, this method allows researchers to compare two or more standardized coefficients simultaneously in a standard and convenient way. Three real examples are given to illustrate the proposed method, using EQS, a popular SEM software program. Results show that the proposed method performs satisfactorily for testing the equality of standardized coefficients.

		A family of scaling corrections aimed to improve the chi-square approximation of goodness-of-fit test statistics in small samples,
		large models,
		and nonnormal data was proposed in Satorra and Bentler (1994).
		For structural equations models,
		Satorra-Bentler's (SB) scaling corrections are available in standard computer software.
		Often,
		however,
		the interest is not on the overall fit of a model,
		but on a test of the restrictions that a null model say $M_{0}$ implies on a less restricted one $M_{1}$.
		If $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$ denote the goodness-of-fit test statistics associated to $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$,
		respectively,
		then typically the difference $T_{d} = T_{0} - T_{1}$ is used as a chi-square test statistic with degrees of freedom equal to the difference on the number of independent parameters estimated under the models $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$.
		As in the case of the goodness-of-fit test,
		it is of interest to scale the statistic $T_{d}$ in order to improve its chi-square approximation in realistic,
		that is,
		nonasymptotic and nonormal,
		applications.
		In a recent paper,
		Satorra (2000) shows that the difference between two SB scaled test statistics for overall model fit does not yield the correct SB scaled difference test statistic.
		Satorra developed an expression that permits scaling the difference test statistic,
		but his formula has some practical limitations,
		since it requires heavy computations that are not available in standard computer software.
		The purpose of the present paper is to provide an easy way to compute the scaled difference chi-square statistic from the scaled goodness-of-fit test statistics of models $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$.
		A Monte Carlo study is provided to illustrate the performance of the competing statistics.

		Robust corrections to standard errors and test statistics have wide applications in structural equation modeling (SEM). 
		The original SEM development, due to Satorra and Bentler (1988, 1994), was to account for the effect of nonnormality. 
		Muth\'{e}n (1993) proposed corrections to accompany certain categorical data estimators, such as cat-LS or cat-DWLS.

		Despite the diversity of applications, all robust corrections are constructed using the same underlying rationale:

		This article provides an overview of different computational options for inference following normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM) with incomplete normal and nonnormal data.

		These computational options include whether the information matrix is observed or expected,
		whether the observed information matrix is estimated numerically or using an analytic asymptotic approximation,
		and whether the information matrix and the outer product matrix of the score vector are evaluated at the saturated or at the structured estimates.
		A variety of different standard errors and robust test statistics become possible by varying these options.
		We review the asymptotic properties of these computational variations, and we show how to obtain them using lavaan in R.

		In real data analysis with structural equation modeling,

		If we ignore the non-normality reality,
		the parameter estimates,
		standard error estimates,
		and model fit statistics from normal theory based methods such as maximum likelihood (ML) and normal theory based generalized least squares estimation (GLS) are unreliable.
		On the other hand,
		the asymptotically distribution free (ADF) estimator does not rely on any distribution assumption but cannot demonstrate its efficiency advantage with small and modest sample sizes.
		The methods which adopt misspecified loss functions including ridge GLS (RGLS) can provide better estimates and inferences than the normal theory based methods and the ADF estimator in some cases.
		We propose a distributionally weighted least squares (DLS) estimator,
		and expect that it can perform better than the existing generalized least squares,
		because it combines normal theory based and ADF based generalized least squares estimation.
		Computer simulation results suggest that model-implied covariance based DLS (DLSM) provided relatively accurate and efficient estimates in terms of RMSE.
		In addition,
		the empirical standard errors,
		the relative biases of standard error estimates,
		and the Type I error rates of the Jiang-Yuan rank adjusted model fit test statistic (TJY) in DLSM were competitive with the classical methods including ML, GLS, and RGLS.
		The performance of DLSM depends on its tuning parameter a.
		We illustrate how to implement DLSM and select the optimal a by a bootstrap procedure in a real data example.
