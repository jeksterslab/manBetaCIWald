		The asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) test statistic 
		for covariance structure analysis (CSA) 
		has been reported to perform very poorly in simulation studies, 
		i.e. it leads to inaccurate decisions 
		regarding the adequacy of models of psychological processes. 
		It is shown in the present study 
		that the poor performance of the ADF test statistic 
		is due to inadequate estimation of the weight matrix
		($W = \boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{-1}$), 
		which is a critical quantity in the ADF theory. 
		Bootstrap procedures based on Hall's bias reduction perspective 
		are proposed to correct the ADF test statistic. 
		It is shown that the bootstrap correction 
		of additive bias on the ADF test statistic 
		yields the desired tail behaviour 
		as the sample size reaches 500 
		for a 15-variable-3-factor confirmatory factor-analytic model, 
		even if the distribution of the observed variables 
		is not multivariate normal 
		and the latent factors are dependent. 
		These results help to revive the ADF theory in CSA.

		In covariance structure analysis, 
		the asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) method 
		fails to work satisfactorily unless the sample is extremely large. 
		Simulation studies report that the ADF test statistics observed 
		are usually too large 
		and correct models are then over-rejected. 
		It is known that the accuracy of the ADF test statistic 
		depends on the estimation of the weight matrix. 
		In existing literature and computer software, 
		a biased estimator $\tilde{W}$
		is used as an estimate of the unknown weight matrix.
		In this article,
		we suggest that $\hat{W}$,
		an unbiased estimate of the weight matrix,
		may eliminate the small or intermediate sample size bias
		of the ADF test statistic.
		Results show that the test statistics based 
		on $\tilde{W}$ and $\hat{W}$ are highly similar.
		The poor performance of the ADF method 
		was not caused by the use of a biased weight matrix 
		in the model studied in this article.

		A high-level language program 
		to obtain the bootstrap-corrected asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) test statistic
		proposed by Yung and Bentler (1994) is reviewed. 
		The program uses the Gauss-Newton algorithm, 
		first 
		to obtain the ADF test statistic 
		from the raw data, 
		and second, 
		to achieve the corrected test statistic 
		from 500 independent bootstrap samples. 
		A generator of nonnormal random samples 
		was also implemented, 
		according to the algorithms of Fleishman (1978) 
		and Vale and Maurelli (1983), 
		which permits the realization of Monte Carlo simulations. 
		Furthermore, 
		the open nature of the program facilitates 
		the inclusion of new procedures as well as the possibility 
		of increased control of the procedures, variables, and equations.
