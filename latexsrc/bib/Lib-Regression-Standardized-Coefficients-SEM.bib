		Mediation models are often used as a means to explain the psychological mechanisms between an independent and a dependent variable in the behavioral and social sciences.
		A major limitation of the unstandardized indirect effect calculated from raw scores is that it cannot be interpreted as an effect-size measure.
		In contrast, the standardized indirect effect calculated from standardized scores can be a good candidate as a measure of effect size because it is scale invariant.
		In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation.
		These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI.
		The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability.
		Mplus, LISREL, and Mx syntax were included to facilitate the use of these preferred methods in applied settings.
		Future issues on the use of the standardized indirect effects are discussed.

		We propose a two-stage method for comparing standardized coefficients in structural equation modeling (SEM).
		At stage 1, we transform the original model of interest into the standardized model by model reparameterization, so that the model parameters appearing in the standardized model are equivalent to the standardized parameters of the original model.
		At stage 2, we impose appropriate linear equality constraints on the standardized model and use a likelihood ratio test to make statistical inferences about the equality of standardized coefficients.
		Unlike other existing methods for comparing standardized coefficients, the proposed method does not require specific modeling features (e.g., specification of nonlinear constraints), which are available only in certain SEM software programs.
		Moreover, this method allows researchers to compare two or more standardized coefficients simultaneously in a standard and convenient way.
		Three real examples are given to illustrate the proposed method, using EQS, a popular SEM software program.
		Results show that the proposed method performs satisfactorily for testing the equality of standardized coefficients.
