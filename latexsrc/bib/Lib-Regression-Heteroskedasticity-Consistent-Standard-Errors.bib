		This paper presents a parameter covariance matrix estimator which is consistent even when the disturbances of a linear regression model are heteroskedastic.
		This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity.
		By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator,
		one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity,
		since in the absence of heteroskedasticity,
		the two estimators will be approximately equal,
		but will generally diverge otherwise.
		The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.

		We examine several modified versions of the heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator of Hinkley (1977) and White (1980).
		On the basis of sampling experiments which compare the performance of quasi t-statistics, we find that one estimator, based on the jackknife, performs better in small samples than the rest.
		We also examine the finite-sample properties of using modified critical values based on Edgeworth approximations, as proposed by Rothenberg (1984).
		In addition, we compare the power of several tests for heteroskedasticity, and find that it may be wise to employ the jackknife heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix even in the absence of detected heteroskedasticity.

		This paper is concerned with the estimation of covariance matrices in the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown forms.
		Currently available estimators that are designed for this context depend upon the choice of a lag truncation parameter and a weighting scheme.
		Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as $T \to \infty$ that is sufficient for consistency.
		No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme.
		In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown.
		This paper addresses these problems.
		The asymptotic truncated mean squared errors of estimators in a given class are determined and compared.
		Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained using an asymptotic truncated mean squared error criterion.
		Using these results, data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are introduced.
		The finite sample properties of the estimators are analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation.

		The sandwich estimator, also known as robust covariance matrix estimator, heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimate, or empirical covariance matrix estimator, has achieved increasing use in the econometric literature as well as with the growing popularity of generalized estimating equations.
		Its virtue is that it provides consistent estimates of the covariance matrix for parameter estimates even when the fitted parametric model fails to hold or is not even specified.
		Surprisingly though, there has been little discussion of properties of the sandwich method other than consistency.
		We investigate the sandwich estimator in quasi-likelihood models asymptotically, and in the linear case analytically.
		We show that under certain circumstances when the quasi-likelihood model is correct, the sandwich estimate is often far more variable than the usual parametric variance estimate.
		The increased variance is a fixed feature of the method and the price that one pays to obtain consistency even when the parametric model fails or when there is heteroscedasticity.
		We show that the additional variability directly affects the coverage probability of confidence intervals constructed from sandwich variance estimates.
		In fact, the use of sandwich variance estimates combined with $t$-distribution quantiles gives confidence intervals with coverage probability falling below the nominal value.
		We propose an adjustment to compensate for this fact.

		We focus on the finite-sample behavior of heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimators and associated quasi-$t$ tests.
		The estimator most commonly used is that proposed by Halbert White.
		Its finite-sample behavior under both homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity is analyzed using Monte Carlo methods.
		We also consider two other consistent estimators, namely: the HC3 estimator, which is an approximation to the jackknife estimator, and the weighted bootstrap estimator.
		Additionally, we evaluate the finite-sample behavior of two bootstrap quasi-$t$ tests: the test based on a single bootstrapping scheme and the test based on a double, nested bootstrapping scheme.
		The latter is very computer-intensive, but proves to work well in small samples.
		Finally, we propose a new estimator, which we call HC4; it is tailored to take into account the effect of leverage points in the design matrix on associated quasi-$t$ tests.

		Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the covariance of the model parameters.
		Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent (HC) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years.
		To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools.
		In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications.
		The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from the econometric literature.
		Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.

		We evaluate the finite-sample behavior of different heteros-ke-das-ticity-consistent covariance matrix estimators, under both constant and unequal error variances.
		We consider the estimator proposed by Halbert White (HC0), and also its variants known as HC2, HC3, and HC4; the latter was recently proposed by Cribari-Neto (2004).
		We propose a new covariance matrix estimator: HC5.
		It is the first consistent estimator to explicitly take into account the effect that the maximal leverage has on the associated inference.
		Our numerical results show that quasi-$t$ inference based on HC5 is typically more reliable than inference based on other covariance matrix estimators.

		The assumption that all random errors in the linear regression model share the same variance (homoskedasticity) is often violated in practice.
		The ordinary least squares estimator of the vector of regression parameters remains unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal under unequal error variances.
		Many practitioners then choose to base their inferences on such an estimator.
		The usual practice is to couple it with an asymptotically valid estimation of its covariance matrix, and then carry out hypothesis tests that are valid under heteroskedasticity of unknown form.
		We use numerical integration methods to compute the exact null distributions of some quasi-t test statistics, and propose a new covariance matrix estimator.
		The numerical results favor testing inference based on the estimator we propose.

		The multivariate delta method was used by Yuan and Chan to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals for standardized regression coefficients.
		Jones and Waller extended the earlier work to situations where data are nonnormal by utilizing Browne’s asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory.
		Furthermore, Dudgeon developed standard errors and confidence intervals, employing heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) estimators, that are robust to nonnormality with better performance in smaller sample sizes compared to Jones and Waller’s ADF technique.
		Despite these advancements, empirical research has been slow to adopt these methodologies.
		This can be a result of the dearth of user-friendly software programs to put these techniques to use.
		We present the betaDelta and the betaSandwich packages in the R statistical software environment in this manuscript.
		Both the normal-theory approach and the ADF approach put forth by Yuan and Chan and Jones and Waller are implemented by the betaDelta package. 
		The HC approach proposed by Dudgeon is implemented by the betaSandwich package.
		The use of the packages is demonstrated with an empirical example.
		We think the packages will enable applied researchers to accurately assess the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.
