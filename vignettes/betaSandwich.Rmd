In this example, a multiple regression model is fitted
using program quality ratings (`QUALITY`) as the regressand/outcome variable
and number of published articles attributed to the program faculty members (`NARTIC`),
percent of faculty members holding research grants (`PCTGRT`), and
percentage of program graduates who received support (`PCTSUPP`) as regressor/predictor variables
using a data set from 1982 ratings of 46 doctoral programs in psychology in the USA (National Research Council, 1982).
Robust confidence intervals for the standardized regression coefficients are generated
using the `BetaHC()` function from the `betaSandwich` package following Dudgeon (2017).

```{r}
#| message = FALSE
library(betaSandwich)
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
if (!exists("nas1982")) {
  try(
    data(
      "nas1982",
      package = "betaSandwich"
    ),
    silent = TRUE
  )
}
df <- nas1982
```

```{r}
df <- betaSandwich::nas1982
```

## Fit the regression model using the `lm()` function.

```{r}
object <- lm(QUALITY ~ NARTIC + PCTGRT + PCTSUPP, data = df)
```

## Estimate the standardized regression slopes and the corresponding robust sampling covariance matrix.

```{r}
BetaHC(object, type = "hc3")
```

## Methods

```{r}
out <- BetaHC(object, type = "hc3")
```

### summary

Summary of the results of `BetaHC()`.

```{r}
summary(out)
```

### coef

Calculate the standardized regression slopes.

```{r}
coef(out)
```

### vcov

Calculate the robust sampling covariance matrix of the standardized regression slopes.

```{r}
vcov(out)
```

### confint

Generate robust confidence intervals for standardized regression slopes.

```{r}
confint(out, level = 0.95)
```
