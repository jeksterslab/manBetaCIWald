  abtsract = {An investigation of the distributional characteristics of 440 large-sample achievement and psychometric measures found all to be significantly nonnormal at the alpha .01 significance level. Several classes of contamination were found, including tail weights from the uniform to the double exponential, exponential-level asymmetry, severe digit preferences, multimodalities, and modes external to the mean/median interval. Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions. A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.},

This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.},

We consider the estimator proposed by Halbert White (HC0), and also its variants known as HC2, HC3, and HC4; the latter was recently proposed by Cribari-Neto (2004). We propose a new covariance matrix estimator: HC5. It is the first consistent estimator to explicitly take into account the effect that the maximal leverage has on the associated inference. Our numerical results show that quasi-$t$ inference based on HC5 is typically more reliable than inference based on other covariance matrix estimators.},

Jones and Waller (Psychometrika 80:365–378, 2015. doi:10.1007/S11336-013-9380-Y) extended these developments to circumstances where data are non-normal by examining confidence intervals based on Browne's (Br J Math Stat Psychol 37:62–83, 1984. doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1984.tb00789.x) asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory. Seven different heteroscedastic-consistent (HC) estimators were investigated in the current study as potentially better solutions for constructing confidence intervals on standardized regression coefficients under non-normality. Normal theory, ADF, and HC estimators were evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation. Findings confirmed the superiority of the HC3 (MacKinnon and White, J Econ 35:305–325, 1985. doi:10.1016/0304-4076(85)90158-7) and HC5 (Cribari-Neto and Da Silva, Adv Stat Anal 95:129–146, 2011. doi:10.1007/s10182-010-0141-2) interval estimators over Jones and Waller's ADF estimator under all conditions investigated, as well as over the normal theory method. The HC5 estimator was more robust in a restricted set of conditions over the HC3 estimator. Some possible extensions of HC estimators to other effect size measures are considered for future developments.},

  abstract = {With fixed predictors, the standard method (Cohen, Cohen, West, \& Aiken, 2003, p. 86; Harris, 2001, p. 80; Hays, 1994, p. 709) for computing confidence intervals (CIs) for standardized regression coefficients fails to account for the sampling variability of the criterion standard deviation. With random predictors, this method also fails to account for the sampling variability of the predictor standard deviations. Nevertheless, under some conditions the standard method will produce CIs with accurate coverage rates. To delineate these conditions, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute empirical CI coverage rates in samples drawn from 36 populations with a wide range of data characteristics. We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed in the literature: noncentrality interval estimation, the delta method, the percentile bootstrap, and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap. Our results showed that for many data-parameter configurations--for example, sample size, predictor correlations, coefficient of determination ($R^2$), orientation of $\beta$ with respect to the eigenvectors of the predictor correlation matrix, $R_X$--the standard method produced coverage rates that were close to their expected values. However, when population $R^2$ was large 	and when $\beta$ approached the last eigenvector of $R_X$, then the standard method coverage rates were frequently below the nominal rate (sometimes by a considerable amount). In these conditions, the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures were consistently accurate. Results using noncentrality interval estimation were inconsistent. In light of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the delta method to evaluate the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},

The sample standardized regression coefficients are also biased in general, although it should not be a concern in practice when the sample size is not too small. Monte Carlo results imply that, for both standardized and unstandardized sample regression coefficients, SE estimates based on asymptotics tend to under-predict the empirical ones at smaller sample sizes.},

  abstract = {The multivariate delta method was used by Yuan and Chan to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals for standardized regression coefficients. Jones and Waller extended the earlier work to situations where data are nonnormal by utilizing Browne’s asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory. Furthermore, Dudgeon developed standard errors and confidence intervals, employing heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) estimators, that are robust to nonnormality with better performance in smaller sample sizes compared to Jones and Waller’s ADF technique. Despite these advancements, empirical research has been slow to adopt these methodologies. This can be a result of the dearth of user-friendly software programs to put these techniques to use. We present the betaDelta and the betaSandwich packages in the R statistical software environment in this manuscript. Both the normal-theory approach and the ADF approach put forth by Yuan and Chan and Jones and Waller are implemented by the betaDelta package. The HC approach proposed by Dudgeon is implemented by the betaSandwich package. The use of the packages is demonstrated with an empirical example. We think the packages will enable applied researchers to accurately assess the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},
