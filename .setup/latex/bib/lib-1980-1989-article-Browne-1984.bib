  abstract = {Methods for obtaining tests of fit of structural models for covariance matrices and estimator standard error which are asymptotically distribution free are derived. Modifications to standard normal theory tests and standard errors which make them applicable to the wider class of elliptical distributions are provided.  A random sampling experiment to investigate some of the proposed methods is described.},
